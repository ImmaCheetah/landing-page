            <div class="quote">"I'm not a vegetarian because I love animals. I'm a vegetarian because I hate plants. They're just so... static. You know, you plant them in the ground, and they just stay there, forever, being all plant-like. Boring. Also, I don't trust anything that's green, or that can be eaten by goats. Goats will eat anything. You could put a tin can in front of a goat, and it would be like, 'Yeah, I'll give that a go.' Can't trust 'em. But vegetables? They're the worst. They're always pretending to be something they're not. You think you're biting into a carrot, and suddenly it's a parsnip. Or you think you're eating a nice, juicy tomato, and it turns out to be a beetroot. I mean, who wants that kind of uncertainty in their life? Give me a nice, reliable bowl of pasta any day. At least you know where you stand with pasta."</div>
